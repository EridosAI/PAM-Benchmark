# PAM-Benchmark
Benchmark and implementation for Predictive Associative Memory (PAM) — a JEPA-based predictor trained on temporal co-occurrence that retrieves associatively linked memories across embedding space boundaries where similarity-based retrieval fundamentally cannot. Companion code for the PAM paper. PyTorch + CUDA.
